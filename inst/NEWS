BUG FIXES

    o	leiv(n=n, cor=r, sdRatio=l) would fail if r = 0;
	similarly, leiv(y~x) would fail if cor(x,y) = 0.

    o	plot(l, plotType="scatter") would fail without explanation
	if the leiv object l was generated using sufficient statistics
	instead of data.

    o   improved plotting of colinear cases.
