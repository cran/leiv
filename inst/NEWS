		CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0-6


DOCUMENTATION

    o   new maintainer email address.



		CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0-5


PERFORMANCE

    o   numerical integrations use the built-in function integrate instead of
	calling the underlying QUADPACK routines dqags and dqagi.



		CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0-4


BUG FIXES

    o   repaired NAMESPACE omissions that prevented installation in R 2.13.



		CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0-3


PERFORMANCE

    o   compatibility updates for R 2.14.



		CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0-2


DOCUMENTATION

    o   complete reference to related publication.



		CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0-1


FEATURES

    o   can use another leiv object as the prior density.

BUG FIXES

    o	posterior density normalization could fail without explanation
	for nearly linear input data.

    o	improved checking for exceptional inputs.

PERFORMANCE

    o	improved efficiency of numerical integrations with direct
	calls to QUADPACK routines dqags and dqagi.

    o	stabilized utility functions p50 and probInt.



		CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-1


BUG FIXES

    o	leiv(n=n, cor=r, sdRatio=l) would fail if r = 0;
	similarly, leiv(y~x) would fail if cor(x,y) = 0.

    o	plot(l, plotType="scatter") would fail without explanation
	if the leiv object l was generated using sufficient statistics
	instead of data.

    o   improved plotting of colinear cases.
